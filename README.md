# Vite File Upload Project

## Overview

This project is a React application built with Vite, featuring a FileUploadPreview component. It demonstrates file upload functionality, file preview, and simulated image manipulation, all within a responsive user interface.

## Features

- User authentication (mock implementation)
- File upload for various types (images, audio, video, PDF)
- File preview based on file type
- File type detection and display
- Image manipulation simulation
- Responsive design using React-Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

- `src/page/FileUploadPreview.jsx`: The main component handling file upload and preview functionality.
- `src/App.jsx`: The root component of the application.
- `src/main.jsx`: The entry point of the application.

## FileUploadPreview Component

The `FileUploadPreview` component is the core of this project. It handles:

1. User authentication (mock implementation)
2. File selection and upload
3. File preview generation
4. File type detection
5. Simulated image manipulation

For detailed usage of this component, refer to the comments within `FileUploadPreview.jsx`.

## Customization

You can customize the project by:

- Modifying the `FileUploadPreview.jsx` component to change its behavior or appearance.
- Updating the styling in `index.css` or adding new CSS/SCSS files.
- Adding new components in the `src/page/` directory.
- Modifying `App.jsx` to change the overall structure of the application.

## Notes

- The authentication system is a mock implementation. For a production application, replace it with a proper authentication mechanism.
- File uploads and image manipulation are simulated. Implement actual file upload and processing functionality for a production environment.
